# PRDs (Product Requirements Documents)

This folder contains all product requirement documents.

## Purpose

PRDs define **WHAT** we're building and **WHY**. Write a PRD before starting any feature.

## When to Create a PRD

- ✅ Starting a new feature
- ✅ Major changes to existing features
- ✅ New product/service
- ✅ Complex bug fixes that need planning

## PRD Template

Use this structure:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] PRD

## Overview
**What:** Brief description
**Why:** Business value
**Who:** Target users

## Requirements

### Must Have
1. Requirement 1
2. Requirement 2

### Should Have
1. Nice to have 1
2. Nice to have 2

### Won't Have (This Version)
1. Future feature 1

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Metric 1
- [ ] Metric 2

## Timeline
- Draft: YYYY-MM-DD

## Examples

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple** - Clear and concise
2. **Focus on WHAT, not HOW** - Leave implementation details for later
3. **Include success metrics** - How do we know it works?
4. **Link to other docs** - Context is important
5. **Update when changes happen** - Living document
